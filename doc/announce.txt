Hello! 

The GNU project is pleased to announce the availability of Libgcrypt
version 1.4.5.

Libgcrypt is a general purpose library of cryptographic building
blocks.  It is originally based on code used by GnuPG.  It does not
provide any implementation of OpenPGP or other protocols.  Thorough
understanding of applied cryptography is required to use Libgcrypt. 

Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.5:

 * Fixed minor memory leak in DSA key generation.

 * No more switching to FIPS mode if /proc/version is not readable.

 * Fixed a sigill during Padlock detection on old CPUs.

 * Fixed a hang on some W2000 machines.

 * Boosted SHA-512 performance by 30% on ia32 boxes and gcc 4.3;
   SHA-256 went up by 25%.


Source code is hosted at the GnuPG FTP server and its mirrors as
listed at <http://www.gnupg.org/download/mirrors.html>.  On the
primary server the source file and its digital signature is:

For help on developing with Libgcrypt you should read the included
manual and optional ask on the gcrypt-devel mailing list [1].  Note
that this version is from the stable branch; the current development
version is available at <svn://cvs.gnupg.org/libgcrypt/trunk> .

Improving Libgcrypt is costly, but you can help!  We are looking for
organizations that find Libgcrypt useful and wish to contribute back.
You can contribute by reporting bugs, improve the software [2], order
extensions or support or more general by donating money to the Free
Software movement (e.g. <http://www.fsfe.org/donate/>).

Commercial support contracts for Libgcrypt are available [3], and they
help finance continued maintenance.  g10 Code GmbH, a Duesseldorf
based company, is currently funding Libgcrypt development.  We are
always looking for interesting development projects.

Many thanks to all who contributed to Libgcrypt development, be it bug
fixes, code, documentation, testing or helping users.


Happy hacking,

  Werner
