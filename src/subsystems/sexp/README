This directory contains Libgcrypt's default implementation of the
S-expression (`sexp') subsystem.  When built, this subsystem will be
put into a library named `libgcrypt-sexp.la'.

S-expressions are used by the public key functions to pass complex
data structures around.  These LISP like objects are used by some
cryptographic protocols (cf. RFC-2692) and Libgcrypt provides
functions to parse and construct them.  For detailed information, see
`Ron Rivest, code and description of S-expressions,
`http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sexp.html''.
